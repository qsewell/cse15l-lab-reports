The next image displays me logging into my CSE 15L course-specific account on ieng6 using the alias I chose (CS15L).

The next image captures me using the alias that I defined (CS15L) to facilitate my use of scp. One can see from this image that I copied a file called "Hello.java" in the home directory of my computer to the home directory for my user on ieng6.
